Variable definitions:

ID - Id of record
DATOP - Date of flight
FLTID - Id of flight ( like id of bus line )
DEPSTN - Departure point
ARRSTN - Arrival point
STD - Scheduled Time departure
STA - Scheduled Time arrival
STATUS - Flight status
AC - Aircraft Code
target - Flight Delay ( in minutes )


This project aims to predict the estimated duration of flight delays per flight

This solution proposes to build a flight delay predictive model using Machine Learning techniques. The accurate prediction of flight delays will help all players in the air travel ecosystem to set up effective action plans to reduce the impact of the delays and avoid loss of time, capital and resources.
